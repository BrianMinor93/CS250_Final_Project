##  Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective  

This repository contains my **Sprint Review and Retrospective** deliverable from the **SNHU Travel project**, completed in the final module of CS 250.  
This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply Agile and Scrum methodologies throughout the software development lifecycle by reflecting on the roles of **Developer, Tester, Product Owner, and Scrum Master**.

##  Reflection

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the user’s goals and translating them into functional software requirements. Creating **user stories** is an effective Agile tool for this, as it breaks down user expectations into actionable, testable increments that the team can deliver iteratively.  
During the SNHU Travel project, user stories helped ensure every feature directly addressed a customer need—such as viewing destinations or navigating trip options—so the team stayed focused on value-driven outcomes. This process kept development user-centered rather than task-centered.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development through an **iterative, incremental**, and **feedback-driven** process grounded in Agile principles. My goal is to plan small, achievable sprints that produce working software early and often.  
Key Agile processes I plan to carry forward include:
- **Daily Standups** for continuous communication  
- **Sprint Planning** for realistic workload estimation  
- **Sprint Reviews** for stakeholder feedback  
- **Retrospectives** for process improvement  

These practices promote adaptability, transparency, and continuous learning—all essential in professional software development.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means **communicating clearly, supporting others, and taking accountability** for shared goals.  
In Agile environments, team success depends on collaboration and openness. As both Scrum Master and Developer, I learned the importance of maintaining transparency through progress updates, removing blockers for teammates, and celebrating shared achievements.  
A good team member fosters trust, embraces feedback, and focuses on delivering quality code that aligns with user needs and team objectives.

##  Summary
The **Agile and Scrum framework** used in the SNHU Travel project enabled consistent delivery, adaptability to changing requirements, and strong collaboration among team members. This experience strengthened my ability to analyze user needs, implement technical solutions effectively, and contribute to a cohesive Agile development team.  
The Sprint Review and Retrospective serves as a valuable reflection of my growth in Agile software practices and my readiness to apply these principles in future software engineering roles.
